/**
 *  The MinPQ class represents a priority queue of generic keys.
 *  It supports the usual insert and delete-the-minimum>
 *  operations, along with methods for peeking at the minimum key,
 *  testing if the priority queue is empty, and iterating through
 *  the keys.
 *  
 *  This implementation uses a binary heap.
 *  The insert and delete-the-minimum operations take logarithmic amortized time.

 *  The min, siz, and is-empty operations take constant time.
 *  Construction takes time proportional to the specified capacity or the number of items used to initialize the data structure.
